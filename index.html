            <h2>Who I am</h2>
            <p>
                I don’t have the habit of writing much about myself. I’m Daksya, a representative of humankind from planet Earth.
                I have my own hobbies, opinions, and feelings. I spend my time playing games or working on
                some projects as far as my laziness allows. Most of them no one has ever seen and probably
                never will. Perhaps you could call me a creator, since I generate some
                content that goes beyond a meaningless
                dataset from philosophical/psychological or technical points of view.
    
                This page is a guide for communicating with me. If you want to make contact,
                use this page and our dialogue will be friendly, calm, respectful, and so on.
            </p>

            <h3>On communication style</h3>
            <p>
                You can use any communication style that’s comfortable for you, without insults,
                personal attacks if you’re a stranger to me, inconveniences, and so on. Nevertheless,
                I prefer light and playful conversation without shyness.
            </p>
            <h3>On politics</h3>
            <p>
                I don’t know what’s best for the world, but I drift between liberal and techno-anarchist ideas. I can be a radical and I couldn’t care less.
            </p>
    
            <h3>If I ignore or block you</h3>
            <p>
                If our conversation was long and pleasant, I probably did
                this due to nerve issues, and things will be fine soon.

            <h2>How to ask me questions</h2>
            <p>
                Sometimes people ask me questions, most often related to code. Almost every time
                I experience some rejection of the way those questions are asked. To address this,
                here are the rules for “how to ask a good question.” These rules
                are nearly universal, and if you follow them, you’ll likely get help.
            </p>
            <p>
                Never ask a question just for the sake of asking. For example, you asked: <br>
                <pre class="code"><code>
Do you know C?
                </code></pre> <br>
                Don’t do that. This question is bad in every way.
                If you have a specific problem, I can help solve it, since I more or less
                understand (or don’t) something about writing code. It often happened that I helped people
                with technologies I don’t know. But my experience in amateur activities,
                and the skills developed through it, help me do that. <br>
                How to do it right? <br>
                If you’re not sure the person you’re asking understands the topic,
                regardless of circumstances you must describe your problem well. A question
                must include: a detailed problem description, attempts to solve it
                yourself and their outcomes, code samples/files/screenshots/other attachments. They should be
                prepared for the reader’s convenience. That is, code must be properly formatted —
                for example, in Discord you can wrap code in ```code```, files should have sensible names rather than
                “wweqwqeo,” screenshots shouldn’t hide information that could help the reader,
                and should not be taken... on a phone or a camera. You’ve read everything and now
                you’re ready to form your question. Let’s take an arbitrary problem that doesn’t require
                writing a lot, showing lengthy attempts to fix and debug — yet 99% of people even
                for such a problem fail to form a proper question. <br>
                <pre class="code"><code>
A problem occurred. I’m trying to write a ternary operator in C, but I get an error:
error: incompatible types when initializing type 'char' using type 'const char *'

Here is my code:
```
char result = (1 > 0) ? "Greater than 0" : "Less than 0";
```
I tried for a long time to solve this, but because I don’t know how to read compiler errors or search properly,
I can’t fix it.
                </code></pre>
                This question isn’t lazy. I’ll be happy to answer such a question.
                I’ll add: don’t ask a question immediately when a problem appears. Sit down,
                think — think for a day, two, three. As long as you can. No one likes answering a question every
                five seconds.
